NEW QUESTION 1\par
- (Topic 2)\par
An organization is using AWS since a few months. The finance team wants to visualize the pattern of AWS\par
spending. Which of the below AWS tool will help for this requirement?\par
A. AWS Cost Manager\par
B. AWS Cost Explorer\par
C. AWS CloudWatch\par
D. AWS Consolidated Billing\par
\par
Explanation:\par
The AWS Billing and Cost Management console includes the Cost Explorer tool for viewing AWS cost data as\par
a graph. It does not charge extra to user for this service. With Cost Explorer the user can filter graphs using\par
resource tags or with services in AWS. If the organization is using Consolidated Billing it helps generate\par
report based on linked accounts. This will help organization to identify areas that require further inquiry. The\par
organization can view trends and use that to understand spend and to predict future costs.\par

Auto Scaling based on a schedule allows the user to scale the application in response to predictable load\par
changes. To configure the Auto Scaling group to scale based on a schedule, the user needs to create\par
scheduled actions. A scheduled action tells Auto Scaling to perform a scaling action at a certain time in the\par
future.\par
NEW QUESTION 6\par

NEW QUESTION 8\par
- (Topic 2)\par
A sys admin is maintaining an application on AWS. The application is installed on EC2 and user has\par
configured ELB and Auto Scaling. Considering future load increase, the user is planning to launch new\par
servers proactively so that they get registered with ELB. How can the user add these instances with Auto\par
Scaling?\par
A. Increase the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group\par
B. Increase the maximum limit of the Auto Scaling group\par
C. Launch an instance manually and register it with ELB on the fly\par
D. Decrease the minimum limit of the Auto Scaling grou\par
\par
Explanation:\par
A user can increase the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group and Auto Scaling will launch a new\par
instance as per the new capacity. The newly launched instances will be registered with ELB if Auto Scaling\par
group is configured with ELB. If the user decreases the minimum size the instances will be removed from\par
Auto Scaling. Increasing the maximum size will not add instances but only set the maximum instance cap.\par

A. The policy will allow the user to perform all read only activities on the EC2 services\par
B. The policy will allow the user to list all the EC2 resources except EBS\par
C. The policy will allow the user to perform all read and write activities on the EC2 services\par
D. The policy will allow the user to perform all read only activities on the EC2 services except load Balancing\par
\par
Explanation:\par
AWS Identity and Access Management is a web service which allows organizations to manage users and\par
user permissions for various AWS services. If an organization wants to setup read only access to EC2 for a\par
particular user, they should mention the action in the IAM policy which entitles the user for Describe rights for\par
EC2, CloudWatch, Auto Scaling and ELB. In the policy shown below, the user will have read only access for\par
EC2 and EBS, CloudWatch and Auto Scaling. Since ELB is not mentioned as a part of the list, the user will\par
not have access to ELB.\par

useful to the admin to understand the concepts about a snapshot?\par
A. The snapshot is synchronous\par
B. It is recommended to stop the instance before taking a snapshot for consistent data\par
C. The snapshot is incremental\par
D. The snapshot captures the data that has been written to the hard disk when the snapshot command was\par
executed\par
\par
Explanation:\par
The AWS snapshot is a point in time backup of an EBS volume. When the snapshot command is executed it\par
will capture the current state of the data that is written on the drive and take a backup. For a better and\par
consistent snapshot of the root EBS volume, AWS recommends stopping the instance. For additional\par
volumes it is recommended to unmount the device. The snapshots are asynchronous and incremental.\par

A user has created a VPC with public and private subnets using the VPC wizard. The VPC has CIDR\par
20.0.0.0/16. The private subnet uses CIDR 20.0.0.0/24 . The NAT instance ID is i-a12345. Which of the below\par
mentioned entries are required in the main route table attached with the private subnet to allow instances to\par
connect with the internet?\par
A. Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 and Target: i-a12345\par
B. Destination: 20.0.0.0/0 and Target: 80\par
C. Destination: 20.0.0.0/0 and Target: i-a12345\par
D. Destination: 20.0.0.0/24 and Target: i-a12345\par
\par
Explanation:\par
A user can create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. If the user has created a public\par
private subnet, the instances in the public subnet can receive inbound traffic directly from the Internet,\par
whereas the instances in the private subnet cannot. If these subnets are created with Wizard, AWS will create\par
two route tables and attach to the subnets. The main route table will have the entry u201cDestination:\par
0.0.0.0/0 and Target: ia12345u201d, which allows all the instances in the private subnet to connect to the\par
internet using NAT.\par

AWS Identity and Access Management is a web service which allows organizations to manage users and\par
user permissions for various AWS services. The user is managing an AWS account for an organization that\par
already has an identity system, such as the login system for the corporate network (SSO.. In this case,\par
instead of creating individual IAM users or groups for each user who need AWS access, it may be more\par
practical to use a proxy server to translate the user identities from the organization network into the temporary\par
AWS security credentials. This proxy server will attach an IAM role to the user after authentication.\par

B. It will make all the objects of the bucket cloudacademy as public\par
C. It will make the bucket cloudacademy as public\par
D. the aws.jpg object as public\par
\par
Explanation:\par
A system admin can grant permission to the S3 objects or buckets to any user or make objects public using\par
the bucket policy and user policy. Both use the JSON-based access policy language. Generally if the user is\par
defining the ACL on the bucket, the objects in the bucket do not inherit it and vice a versa. The bucket policy\par
can be defined at the bucket level which allows the objects as well as the bucket to be public with a single\par

Explanation:\par
The Elastic Load Balancer connection draining feature causes the load balancer to stop sending new\par
requests to the back-end instances when the instances are deregistering or become unhealthy, while\par
ensuring that inflight requests continue to be served. The user can enable or disable connection draining from\par

An organization is generating digital policy files which are required by the admins for verification. Once the\par
files are verified they may not be required in the future unless there is some compliance issue. If the\par
organization wants to save them in a cost effective way, which is the best possible solution?\par
A. AWS RRS\par

Explanation:\par
Amazon S3 stores objects according to their storage class. There are three major storage classes: Standard,\par
Reduced Redundancy and Glacier. Standard is for AWS S3 and provides very high durability. However, the\par
costs are a little higher. Reduced redundancy is for less critical files. Glacier is for archival and the files which\par
are accessed infrequently. It is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure and durable\par

A user has created an Auto Scaling group with default configurations from CLI. The user wants to setup the\par
CloudWatch alarm on the EC2 instances, which are launched by the Auto Scaling group. The user has setup\par
an alarm to monitor the CPU utilization every minute. Which of the below mentioned statements is true?\par
A. It will fetch the data at every minute but the four data points [corresponding to 4 minutes] will not have\par
value since the EC2 basic monitoring metrics are collected every five minutes\par
B. It will fetch the data at every minute as detailed monitoring on EC2 will be enabled by the default launch\par
configuration of Auto Scaling\par
C. The alarm creation will fail since the user has not enabled detailed monitoring on the EC2 instances\par
D. The user has to first enable detailed monitoring on the EC2 instances to support alarm monitoring at every\par
minute\par
\par
Explanation:\par
CloudWatch is used to monitor AWS as well as the custom services. To enable detailed instance monitoring\par
for a new Auto Scaling group, the user does not need to take any extra steps. When the user creates an Auto\par
Scaling launch config using CLI, each launch configuration contains a flag named\par
InstanceMonitoring.Enabled. The default value of this flag is true. Thus, by default detailed monitoring will be\par
enabled for Auto Scaling as well as for all the instances launched by that Auto Scaling group.\par

You have an Auto Scaling group associated with an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). You have noticed that\par
instances launched via the Auto Scaling group are being marked unhealthy due to an ELB health check, but\par
these unhealthy instances are not being terminated\par
What do you need to do to ensure trial instances marked unhealthy by the ELB will be terminated and\par

C. Increase the value for the Health check interval set on the Elastic Load Balancer\par
D. Change the health check set on the Elastic Load Balancer to use TCP rather than HTTP checks\par
\par
Explanation: Reference:\par
{{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/as-add-elb-healthcheck.html }}{\fldrslt{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/as-add-elb-healthcheck.html\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22\par
Add an Elastic Load Balancing Health Check to your Auto Scaling Group\par
By default, an Auto Scaling group periodically reviews the results of EC2 instance status to determine the\par
health state of each instance. However, if you have associated your Auto Scaling group with an Elastic Load\par
Balancing load balancer, you can choose to use the Elastic Load Balancing health check. In this case, Auto\par
Scaling determines the health status of your instances by checking the results of both the EC2 instance status\par
check and the Elastic Load Balancing instance health check.\par
For information about EC2 instance status checks, see.Monitor Instances With Status Checks.in the.Amazon\par
EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. For information about Elastic Load Balancing health checks, see.Health\par
Check.in the.Elastic Load Balancing Developer Guide.\par
This topic shows you how to add an Elastic Load Balancing health check to your Auto Scaling group,\par
assuming that you have created a load balancer and have registered the load balancer with your Auto Scaling\par
group. If you have not registered the load balancer with your Auto Scaling group, see.Set Up a Scaled and\par
Load-Balanced Application.\par

Auto Scaling marks an instance unhealthy if the calls to the Amazon EC2\par
action.DescribeInstanceStatus.return any state other than.running, the system status shows.impaired, or the\par
calls to Elastic Load Balancing action.DescribeInstanceHealth.returns.OutOfService.in the instance state field.\par
If there are multiple load balancers associated with your Auto Scaling group, Auto Scaling checks the health\par
state of your EC2 instances by making health check calls to each load balancer. For each call, if the Elastic\par
Load Balancing action returns any state other than.InService, the instance is marked as unhealthy. After Auto\par
Scaling marks an instance as unhealthy, it remains in that state, even if subsequent calls from other load\par
balancers return an.InService.state for the same instance.\par

D. AWS RRS\par
\par
Explanation:\par
Amazon S3 stores objects according to their storage class. There are three major storage classes: Standard,\par
Reduced Redundancy Storage and Glacier. Standard is for AWS S3 and provides very high durability.\par
However, the costs are a little higher. Glacier is for archival and the files are not available over the internet.\par
Reduced Redundancy Storage is for less critical files. Reduced Redundancy is little cheaper as it provides\par
less durability in comparison to S3. In this case since the log files are not mission critical files, RRS will be a\par
better option.\par

B. In this case, Auto Scaling will send data every minute and will charge the user extra\par
C. Detailed monitoring will send data every minute without additional charges\par
D. Auto Scaling sends data every minute only and does not charge the user\par
Answer: B\par
Explanation:\par
CloudWatch is used to monitor AWS as well as the custom services. It provides either basic or detailed\par
monitoring for the supported AWS products. In basic monitoring, a service sends data points to CloudWatch\par
every five minutes, while in detailed monitoring a service sends data points to CloudWatch every minute. Auto\par
Scaling includes 7 metrics and 1 dimension, and sends data to CloudWatch every 5 minutes by default. The\par
user can enable detailed monitoring for Auto Scaling, which sends data to CloudWatch every minute.\par

A root account owner has created an S3 bucket testmycloud. The account owner wants to allow everyone to\par
upload the objects as well as enforce that the person who uploaded the object should manage the permission\par
of those objects. Which is the easiest way to achieve this?\par
A. The root account owner should create a bucket policy which allows the IAM users to upload the object\par
B. The root account owner should create the bucket policy which allows the other account owners to set the\par
object policy of that bucket\par
C. The root account should use ACL with the bucket to allow everyone to upload the object\par
D. The root account should create the IAM users and provide them the permission to upload content to the\par
bucket\par
Answer: C\par
Explanation:\par
Each AWS S3 bucket and object has an ACL (Access Control List. associated with it. An ACL is a list of\par
grants identifying the grantee and the permission granted. The user can use ACLs to grant basic read/write\par
permissions to other AWS accounts. ACLs use an Amazon S3u2013specific XML schema. The user cannot\par
grant permissions to other users in his account. ACLs are suitable for specific scenarios. For example, if a\par
bucket owner allows other AWS accounts to upload objects, permissions to these objects can only be\par
managed using the object ACL by the AWS account that owns the object.\par

user use the Amazon EC2 to reboot the instance instead of running the operating system reboot command\par
from the instance. The instance remains on the same host computer and maintains its public DNS name,\par
private IP address, and any data on its instance store volumes. It typically takes a few minutes for the reboot\par
to complete, but the time it takes to reboot depends on the instance configuration.\par

A user is launching an EC2 instance in the US East region. Which of the below mentioned options is\par
recommended by AWS with respect to the selection of the availability zone?\par
A. Always select the US-East-1-a zone for HA\par
B. Do not select the AZ; instead let AWS select the AZ\par
C. The user can never select the availability zone while launching an instance\par
D. Always select the AZ while launching an instance\par
Answer: B\par
Explanation:\par
When launching an instance with EC2, AWS recommends not to select the availability zone (AZ.. AWS\par
specifies that the default Availability Zone should be accepted. This is because it enables AWS to select the\par
best Availability Zone based on the system health and available capacity. If the user launches additional\par
instances, only then an Availability Zone should be specified. This is to specify the same or different AZ from\par
the running instances.\par

A user has setup a VPC with CIDR 20.0.0.0/16. The VPC has a private subnet (20.0.1.0/24. and a public\par
subnet (20.0.0.0/24.. The useru2019s data centre has CIDR of 20.0.54.0/24 and 20.1.0.0/24. If the private\par
subnet wants to communicate with the data centre, what will happen?\par
A. It will allow traffic communication on both the CIDRs of the data centre\par
B. It will not allow traffic with data centre on CIDR 20.1.0.0/24 but allows traffic communication on\par
20.0.54.0/24\par
C. It will not allow traffic communication on any of the data centre CIDRs\par
D. It will allow traffic with data centre on CIDR 20.1.0.0/24 but does not allow on 20.0.54.0/24\par
Answer: D\par
Explanation:\par
VPC allows the user to set up a connection between his VPC and corporate or home network data centre. If\par
the user has an IP address prefix in the VPC that overlaps with one of the networks' prefixes, any traffic to the\par
network's prefix is dropped. In this case CIDR 20.0.54.0/24 falls in the VPCu2019s CIDR range of\par
20.0.0.0/16. Thus, it will not allow traffic on that IP. In the case of 20.1.0.0/24, it does not fall in the\par
VPCu2019s CIDR range. Thus, traffic will be allowed on it.\par

C. Communication between the load balancer and back-end instances is always through IPV4\par
D. The ELB supports either IPV4 or IPV6 but not both\par

Elastic Load Balancing supports both Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6. and Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4..\par
Clients can connect to the useru2019s load balancer using either IPv4 or IPv6 (in EC2-Classic. DNS.\par
However, communication between the load balancer and its back-end instances uses only IPv4. The user can\par
use the Dualstack-prefixed DNS name to enable IPv6 support for communications between the client and the\par
load balancers. Thus, the clients are able to access the load balancer using either IPv4 or IPv6 as their\par

A user has launched an EC2 instance store backed instance in the US-East-1a zone. The user created AMI\par
#1 and copied it to the Europe region. After that, the user made a few updates to the application running in\par
the US-East-1a zone. The user makes an AMI#2 after the changes. If the user launches a new instance in\par
Europe from the AMI #1 copy, which of the below mentioned statements is true?\par
A. The new instance will have the changes made after the AMI copy as AWS just copies the reference of the\par
original AMI during the copying. Thus, the copied AMI will have all the updated data\par
B. The new instance will have the changes made after the AMI copy since AWS keeps updating the AMI\par
C. It is not possible to copy the instance store backed AMI from one region to another\par
D. The new instance in the EU region will not have the changes made after the AMI copy\par
Answer: D\par
Explanation:\par
Within EC2, when the user copies an AMI, the new AMI is fully independent of the source AMI; there is no link\par
to the original (source. AMI. The user can modify the source AMI without affecting the new AMI and vice a\par
versa. Therefore, in this case even if the source AMI is modified, the copied AMI of the EU region will not\par
have the changes. Thus, after copy the user needs to copy the new source AMI to the destination region to\par
get those changes.\par

D. Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 and Target: vgw-12345\par
Answer: D\par
Explanation:\par
The user can create subnets as per the requirement within a VPC. If the user wants to connect VPC from his\par
own data centre, he can setup a public and VPN only subnet which uses hardware VPN access to connect\par
with his data centre. When the user has configured this setup with Wizard, it will create a virtual private\par
gateway to route all traffic of the VPN subnet. Here are the valid entries for the main route table in this\par
scenario: Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 & Target: vgw-12345 (To route all internet traffic to the VPN gateway.\par
Destination: 20.0.0.0/16 & Target: local (To allow local routing in VPC.\par

A user has launched an EC2 instance. The user is planning to setup the CloudWatch alarm. Which of the\par
below mentioned actions is not supported by the CloudWatch alarm?\par
A. Notify the Auto Scaling launch config to scale up\par
B. Send an SMS using SNS\par
C. Notify the Auto Scaling group to scale down\par
D. Stop the EC2 instance\par
Answer: B\par
Explanation:\par
A user can create a CloudWatch alarm that takes various actions when the alarm changes state. An alarm\par
watches a single metric over the time period that the user has specified, and performs one or more actions\par
based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods. The actions\par
could be sending a notification to an Amazon Simple Notification Service topic (SMS, Email, and HTTP end\par
point.,notifying the Auto Scaling policy or changing the state of the instance to Stop/Terminate.\par

A. Auto Scaling will execute both processes but will add just one instance on the 1st\par
B. Auto Scaling will add two instances on the 1st of the month\par
C. Auto Scaling will schedule both the processes but execute only one process randomly\par
D. Auto Scaling will throw an error since there is a conflict in the schedule of two separate Auto Scaling\par
Processes\par
Answer: D\par
Explanation:\par
Auto Scaling based on a schedule allows the user to scale the application in response to predictable load\par
changes. The user can also configure the recurring schedule action which will follow the Linux cron format. As\par
per Auto Scaling, a scheduled action must have a unique time value. If the user attempts to schedule an\par
activity at a time when another existing activity is already scheduled, the call will be rejected with an error\par
message noting the conflict.\par

A. In a Multi AZ, AWS runs two DBs in parallel and copies the data asynchronously to the replica copy\par
B. In a Multi AZ, AWS runs two DBs in parallel and copies the data synchronously to the replica copy\par
C. In a Multi AZ, AWS runs just one DB but copies the data synchronously to the standby replica\par
D. AWS MS SQL does not support the Multi AZ feature\par
Answer: C\par
Explanation:\par
Amazon RDS provides high availability and failover support for DB instances using Multi-AZ deployments. In\par
a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica\par
in a different Availability Zone. The primary DB instance is synchronously replicated across Availability Zones\par
to a standby replica to provide data redundancy, eliminate I/O freezes, and minimize latency spikes during\par
system backups. Running a DB instance with high availability can enhance availability during planned system\par
maintenance, and help protect your databases against DB instance failure and Availability Zone\par
disruption.Note that the high-availability feature is not a scaling solution for read-only scenarios; you cannot\par
use a standby replica to serve read traffic. To service read-only traffic, you should use a read replica.\par

Explanation:\par
AWS Cloudformation is an application management tool which provides application modelling, deployment,\par
configuration, management and related activities. It supports a wide variety of AWS services, such as EC2,\par
EBS, AS, ELB, RDS, VPC, etc. It also provides application bootstrapping scripts which enable the user to\par
install software packages or create folders. It is free of the cost and only charges the user for the services\par
created with it. The only challenge is that it does not follow any model, such as DevOps; instead customers\par
can define templates and use them to provision and manage the AWS resources in an orderly way.\par

AWS provides an option to have programmatic access to billing. Programmatic Billing Access leverages the\par
existing Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3. APIs. Thus, the user can build applications that\par
reference his billing data from a CSV (comma-separated value. file stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. To\par
enable programmatic access, the user has to first enable the monthly billing report. Then the user needs to\par
provide an AWS bucket name where the billing CSV will be uploaded. The user should also enable the\par
Programmatic access option.\par

Amazon CloudWatch is basically a metrics repository. Either the user can send the custom data or an AWS\par
product can put metrics into the repository, and the user can retrieve the statistics based on those metrics.\par
The statistics are metric data aggregations over specified periods of time. Aggregations are made using the\par
namespace, metric name, dimensions, and the data point unit of measure, within the time period that is\par
specified by the user. To aggregate the data across instances launched with AMI, the user should select the\par
AMI ID under EC2 metrics and select the aggregate average to view the data.\par

A user has created a VPC with public and private subnets using the VPC wizard. Which of the below\par
mentioned statements is true in this scenario?\par
A. The AWS VPC will automatically create a NAT instance with the micro size\par
B. VPC bounds the main route table with a private subnet and a custom route table with a public subnet\par
C. The user has to manually create a NAT instance D. VPC bounds the main route table with a public subnet\par
and a custom route table with a private subnet\par

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC. is a virtual network dedicated to the useru2019s AWS account. A user can\par
create a subnet with VPC and launch instances inside that subnet. If the user has created a public private\par
subnet, the instances in the public subnet can receive inbound traffic directly from the internet, whereas the\par
instances in the private subnet cannot. If these subnets are created with Wizard, AWS will create a NAT\par
instance of a smaller or higher size, respectively. The VPC has an implied router and the VPC wizard updates\par
the main route table used with the private subnet, creates a custom route table and associates it with the\par

One of the instances has two separate tags with the key/ value as u201cInstanceName/HRu201d,\par
u201cCostCenter/HRu201d. What will AWS do in this case?\par
A. InstanceName is a reserved tag for AWS. Thus, AWS will not allow this tag\par
B. AWS will not allow the tags as the value is the same for different keys\par
C. AWS will allow tags but will not show correctly in the cost allocation report due to the same value of the two\par
separate keys\par
D. AWS will allow both the tags and show properly in the cost distribution report\par
Answer: D\par
Explanation:\par
AWS provides cost allocation tags to categorize and track the AWS costs. When the user applies tags to his\par
AWS resources, AWS generates a cost allocation report as a comma-separated value (CSV file. with the\par
usage and costs aggregated by those tags. Each tag will have a key-value and can be applied to services,\par
such as EC2, S3, RDS, EMR, etc. It is required that the key should be different for each tag. The value can be\par
the same for different keys. In this case since the value is different, AWS will properly show the distribution\par
report with the correct values.\par

Amazon CloudWatch is basically a metrics repository. The AWS product puts metrics into this repository, and\par
the user can retrieve the data or statistics based on those metrics. To distinguish the data for each service,\par
the CloudWatch metric has a namespace. Namespaces are containers for metrics. All AWS services that\par
provide the Amazon CloudWatch data use a namespace string, beginning with "AWS/". All the services which\par
are supported by CloudWatch will have some namespace. CloudWatch does not monitor CloudTrail. Thus,\par
the namespace u201cAWS/CloudTrailu201d is incorrect.\par

A user has configured ELB with Auto Scaling. The user suspended the Auto Scaling terminate process only\par
for a while. What will happen to the availability zone rebalancing process (AZRebalance. during this period?\par
A. Auto Scaling will not launch or terminate any instances\par
B. Auto Scaling will allow the instances to grow more than the maximum size\par
C. Auto Scaling will keep launching instances till the maximum instance size\par
D. It is not possible to suspend the terminate process while keeping the launch active\par
Answer: B\par
Explanation:\par
Auto Scaling performs various processes, such as Launch, Terminate, Availability Zone Rebalance\par
(AZRebalance. etc. The AZRebalance process type seeks to maintain a balanced number of instances across\par
Availability Zones within a region. If the user suspends the Terminate process, the AZRebalance process can\par
cause the Auto Scaling group to grow up to ten percent larger than the maximum size. This is because Auto\par
Scaling allows groups to temporarily grow larger than the maximum size during rebalancing activities. If Auto\par
Scaling cannot terminate instances, the Auto Scaling group could remain up to ten percent larger than the\par
maximum size until the user resumes the Terminate process type.\par

An organization has created 50 IAM users. The organization has introduced a new policy which will change\par
the access of an IAM user. How can the organization implement this effectively so that there is no need to\par
apply the policy at the individual user level?\par
A. Use the IAM groups and add users as per their role to different groups and apply policy to group\par
B. The user can create a policy and apply it to multiple users in a single go with the AWS CLI\par
C. Add each user to the IAM role as per their organization role to achieve effective policy setup\par
D. Use the IAM role and implement access at the role level\par
Answer: A\par
Explanation:\par
With AWS IAM, a group is a collection of IAM users. A group allows the user to specify permissions for a\par
collection of users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users. A group helps an\par
organization manage access in a better way; instead of applying at the individual level, the organization can\par
apply at the group level which is applicable to all the users who are a part of that group.\par

A user is launching an instance. He is on the u201cTag the instanceu201d screen. Which of the below\par
mentioned\par
information will not help the user understand the functionality of an AWS tag?\par
A. Each tag will have a key and value\par
B. The user can apply tags to the S3 bucket\par
C. The maximum value of the tag key length is 64 unicode characters\par
D. AWS tags are used to find the cost distribution of various resources\par
Answer: C\par
Explanation:\par
AWS provides cost allocation tags to categorize and track the AWS costs. When the user applies tags to his\par
AWS resources, AWS generates a cost allocation report as a comma-separated value (CSV file. with the\par
usage and costs aggregated by those tags. Each tag will have a key-value and can be applied to services,\par
such as EC2, S3, RDS, EMR, etc. The maximum size of a tag key is 128 unicode characters.\par

B. 4 hours\par
C. 2 hours\par
D. 1 hour\par
Answer: A\par
Explanation:\par
A user can stop/start or reboot an EC2 instance using the AWS console, the Amazon EC2 CLI or the Amazon\par
EC2 API. Rebooting an instance is equivalent to rebooting an operating system. When the instance is\par
rebooted AWS will not charge the user for the extra hours. In case the user stops the instance, AWS does not\par
charge the running cost but charges only the EBS storage cost. If the user starts and stops the instance\par
multiple times in a single hour, AWS will charge the user for every start and stop. In this case, since the\par
instance was rebooted twice, it will cost the user for 3 instance hours.\par
NEW QUESTION 136\par
- (Topic 2)\par
A sys admin has created a shopping cart application and hosted it on EC2. The EC2 instances are running\par
behind ELB. The admin wants to ensure that the end user request will always go to the EC2 instance where\par
the user session has been created. How can the admin configure this?\par
A. Enable ELB cross zone load balancing\par
B. Enable ELB cookie setup\par
C. Enable ELB sticky session\par
D. Enable ELB connection draining\par
Answer: C\par
Explanation:\par
Generally AWS ELB routes each request to a zone with the minimum load. The Elastic Load Balancer\par
provides a feature called sticky session which binds the useru2019s session with a specific EC2 instance. If\par
the sticky session is enabled the first request from the user will be redirected to any of the EC2 instances.\par
But, henceforth, all requests from the same user will be redirected to the same EC2 instance. This ensures\par
that all requests coming from the user during the session will be sent to the same application instance.\par

A. Stop one of the instances and change the availability zone\par
B. The zone can only be modified using the AWS CLI\par
C. From the AWS EC2 console, select the Actions - > Change zones and specify new zone\par
D. Create an AMI of the running instance and launch the instance in a separate AZ\par
Answer: D\par
Explanation:\par
With AWS EC2, when a user is launching an instance he can select the availability zone (AZ. at the time of\par
launch. If the zone is not selected, AWS selects it on behalf of the user. Once the instance is launched, the\par
user cannot change the zone of that instance unless he creates an AMI of that instance and launches a new\par
instance from it.\par
NEW QUESTION 138\par
- (Topic 2)\par
You are building an online store on AWS that uses SQS to process your customer orders. Your backend\par
system needs those messages in the same sequence the customer orders have been put in. How can you\par
achieve that?\par
A. It is not possible to do this with SQS\par
B. You can use sequencing information on each message\par
C. You can do this with SQS but you also need to use SWF\par
D. Messages will arrive in the same order by default\par
Answer: B\par
Explanation:\par
Amazon SQS is engineered to always be available and deliver messages. One of the resulting tradeoffs is\par
that SQSdoes not guarantee first in, first out delivery of messages. For many distributed applications, each\par
message can stand on its own, and as long as all messages are delivered, the order is not important. If your\par
system requires that order be preserved, you can place sequencing information in each message, so that you\par
can reorder the messages when the queue returns them.\par

A. The user should not use RI; instead only go with the on-demand pricing\par
B. The user should use the AWS high utilized RI\par
C. The user should use the AWS medium utilized RI\par
D. The user should use the AWS low utilized RI\par
Answer: A\par
Explanation:\par
The AWS Reserved Instance provides the user with an option to save some money by paying a one-time\par
fixed amount and then save on the hourly rate. It is advisable that if the user is having 30% or more usage of\par
an instance per day, he should go for a RI. If the user is going to use an EC2 instance for more than\par
2200-2500 hours per year, RI will help the user save some cost. Here, the instance is not going to run for less\par
than 1500 hours. Thus, it is advisable that the user should use the on-demand pricing.\par

Services (AWS. accounts within a single organization by making a single paying account. For billing\par
purposes, consolidated billing treats all the accounts on the consolidated bill as one account. This means that\par
all accounts on a consolidated bill can receive the hourly cost benefit of the Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances\par
purchased by any other account. In this case only one Reserved Instance has been purchased by one\par
account. Thus, only a single instance from any of the accounts will get the advantage of RI. AWS will\par
implement the blended rate for each instance if more than one instance is running concurrently.\par
